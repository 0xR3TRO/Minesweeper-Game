## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Minesweeper Game" project aims to create a logic-based game where players must uncover tiles on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. The game challenges players to think logically and strategically. The goal of the project is to provide an engaging gameplay experience that is both challenging and intellectually stimulating.

### Features Description:

- **Gameplay:** Players uncover tiles on a grid, trying to avoid mines. Each uncovered tile may provide clues about the number of mines in adjacent tiles.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose a difficulty level that affects the size of the grid and the number of mines.
- **Game Save:** Players can save their game progress and resume it later.
- **Leaderboard:** The game tracks players' best scores and displays them on a leaderboard.
- **Training Mode:** A practice mode where players can learn the game without risking a loss, ideal for beginners.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Tile Uncovering:** Players can click on tiles to uncover them. A tile can be empty, display a number indicating nearby mines, or contain a mine (which ends the game).
- **Difficulty Levels:** Players can select from various difficulty levels, which determine grid size and mine count.
- **Game Save and Load:** The game should allow players to save the current state and resume later.
- **Leaderboard:** The application should store and display the best times for completing the game at different difficulty levels.
- **Training Mode:** Players can play in a mode that allows learning without ending the game when a mine is uncovered.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The game should be easy to learn and navigate, with an intuitive user interface.
- **Performance:** The game should run smoothly, without delays, even on devices with lower processing power.
- **Aesthetics:** The gameâ€™s graphics should be clear and aesthetically pleasing, with easily distinguishable tiles and readable numbers.
- **Accessibility:** The game should be accessible on various platforms (e.g., web browsers, mobile devices).

## Interface Design:

### Interface Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Home Screen:_ A screen with options to select the difficulty level, access the leaderboard, and enter training mode.
- _Game Window:_ A grid where the game is played, showing the remaining mine count and a timer.
- _Leaderboard:_ A list of top scores along with completion times for each difficulty level.
- _Game Over Screen:_ A notification of victory or defeat, with options to restart the game or return to the home screen.

### Site Map:

- _Home Screen_
  - Difficulty selection
  - Training mode option
  - Leaderboard access
- _Game Window_
  - Game grid
  - Mine and time counters
  - Save and return to menu options
- _Leaderboard_
  - View top scores
  - Option to reset scores

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to the game, including:

- **Grid:** A matrix containing information about mines and uncovered tiles.
- **Game State:** The current state of the game, including time played, uncovered tiles, and remaining mines.
- **Scores:** A set of data about the best times for different difficulty levels.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The system architecture is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where:

- **Model:** Manages game logic, grid information, and scores.
- **View:** Handles the presentation of the user interface and user interactions.
- **Controller:** Manages game logic, processes data from the model, and sends it to the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js) - for the user interface and game logic.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) - for handling game saves and the leaderboard if backend support is needed.
- **Database:** SQLite or another lightweight database - for storing game scores.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_:
  - Separate files for game logic (e.g., tile uncovering, mine checking), user interface (React components), and data management (score saving).
- _Coding Style_: Use best practices such as modularity, ease of extending functionality, and appropriate code comments.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of functions related to game logic, such as uncovering tiles and counting mines.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure all game elements work together correctly, such as game logic and user interface.
- **User Interface Tests:** Test user interactions with the game on various devices and browsers.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate how the game handles larger grids or runs on older devices.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop test cases for different scenarios, such as finding a mine, correct functioning of counters, etc.
- Test on various platforms (PC, mobile devices) to ensure compatibility.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:**
  - Beta testing with a limited group of users
  - Fixes based on feedback
  - Game release on target platforms (e.g., App Store, Google Play, websites)
- **Timelines:** Set realistic dates for each deployment stage.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Provide users with channels to report bugs and suggest improvements.
- **Updates:** Regular updates to add new features, improve performance, and fix bugs reported by users.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:**
  - Interface and game logic design
  - Implementation of core features (tile uncovering, game logic)
  - Game testing and optimization
  - Preparation for deployment and release
- **Timelines:** Set timeframes needed for each stage, including a buffer for fixes.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Costs related to programming, interface design, and testing.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Hosting, updates, technical support, and potential fees for external services (e.g., servers if the game requires backend support).
